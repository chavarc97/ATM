# Wizard Bank ATM System

Welcome to the Wizard Bank ATM system, a project inspired by the magical world of Harry Potter. This program allows users to perform banking operations and enjoy additional magical features.

## Project Overview

The Wizard Bank ATM system is designed to emulate the functionality of a real-world ATM with a magical twist. It enables users to register accounts, log in, deposit money, withdraw funds, check balances, and even play a magical minigame.

## Modules and Functions

### 1. Registration and Authentication Module

-   **registerUser():** Function to create a new bank account associated with a username, Hogwarts house, blood type, house seal, and PIN for account access.
    
-   **logIn():** Function to log in to an existing account by entering the username and PIN.
    

### 2. Banking Operations Module

-   **deposit():** Function to deposit a specified amount of money into the user's account in the chosen currency.
    
-   **withdraw():** Function to withdraw a specified amount of money from the user's account in the chosen currency.
    
-   **checkBalance():** Function to view the current balance of the user's account in all supported currencies.
    

### Additional Features

-   **Magical Minigame:** Users can play a magical minigame where they guess a number between 1 and 10. A correct guess earns $10 USD, while an incorrect guess results in a $10 USD deduction per attempt.
